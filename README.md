## What I'm Building

### 🤖 [AI Email & Calendar Assistant](https://github.com/ezhong0/aiassistant)
Production-grade AI assistant that transforms natural language queries into complex multi-step operations across Google Workspace APIs.

**Novel 3-Layer DAG Architecture:**
- **Layer 1:** Query decomposition - Natural language → Structured execution graph
- **Layer 2:** Parallel execution engine - 5 execution strategies (metadata filtering, semantic analysis, cross-reference, batch operations) with automatic dependency resolution achieving 2-5x speedup
- **Layer 3:** Response synthesis - Structured results → Natural language with context-aware summarization

**Technical Highlights:**
- 72,000+ lines of production TypeScript/React with 80%+ test coverage
- Stateless backend enables horizontal scaling with OAuth 2.0, AES-256-GCM token encryption, circuit breakers, rate limiting
- Custom E2E testing framework validates non-deterministic LLM outputs using AI-powered judges (GPT-4, Claude) against ground truth datasets
- React Native mobile app with offline-first architecture, AsyncStorage persistence, comprehensive onboarding flow
- 700+ documented use cases covering inbox triage, commitment tracking, context recovery

**Stack:** Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, React Native, Supabase, Docker
