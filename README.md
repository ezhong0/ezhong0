  ## What I'm Building

  ### ü§ñ [AI Email & Calendar Assistant](https://github.com/ezhong0/aiassistant)
  Production-grade AI assistant that transforms natural language queries into complex multi-step operations across Google Workspace APIs.

  **Novel 3-Layer DAG Architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** Query decomposition - Natural language ‚Üí Structured execution graph
  - **Layer 2:** Parallel execution engine - 5 execution strategies (metadata filtering, semantic analysis, cross-reference, batch operations) with automatic dependency resolution
  achieving 2-5x speedup
  - **Layer 3:** Response synthesis - Structured results ‚Üí Natural language with context-aware summarization

  **Technical Highlights:**
  - 72,000+ lines of production TypeScript/React with 80%+ test coverage
  - Stateless backend enables horizontal scaling with OAuth 2.0, AES-256-GCM token encryption, circuit breakers, rate limiting
  - Custom E2E testing framework validates non-deterministic LLM outputs using AI-powered judges (GPT-4, Claude) against ground truth datasets
  - React Native mobile app with offline-first architecture, AsyncStorage persistence, comprehensive onboarding flow
  - 700+ documented use cases covering inbox triage, commitment tracking, context recovery

  **Stack:** Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, React Native, Supabase, Docker

  ### üß† [Ontology-Aware Memory System](https://github.com/ezhong0/ontology-memory)
  > Production-ready memory system that transforms LLM agents from stateless responders into experienced colleagues with perfect recall, business context awareness, and epistemic humility.
   11,864 lines of production Python with pure hexagonal architecture.

  <details>
  <summary><strong>üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights</strong></summary>

  **6-Layer Memory Architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** Raw events (immutable audit trail, provenance tracking)
  - **Layer 2:** Entity resolution (5-stage hybrid: exact ‚Üí alias ‚Üí fuzzy ‚Üí LLM coreference ‚Üí domain lookup)
  - **Layer 3:** Episodic memory (events with semantic meaning, entity tracking)
  - **Layer 4:** Semantic memory (Subject-Predicate-Object triples with confidence decay)
  - **Layer 5:** Procedural memory (learned behavioral patterns)
  - **Layer 6:** Memory summaries (cross-session consolidation)

  **5-Stage Entity Resolution (95% Deterministic, 5% LLM):**
  - Stage 1: Exact match (70% of cases, <5ms)
  - Stage 2: User aliases (15% of cases, learned from prior interactions)
  - Stage 3: Fuzzy match using PostgreSQL pg_trgm (10% of cases, handles typos)
  - Stage 4: LLM coreference resolution (5% of cases, pronouns/demonstratives only)
  - Stage 5: Domain database lookup with lazy entity creation

  **Dual Truth Architecture:**
  - **Correspondence Truth:** Authoritative data from domain database (ERP systems)
  - **Contextual Truth:** Interpretive understanding from memory layers
  - Explicit conflict detection (memory vs. memory, memory vs. DB, temporal inconsistency)

  **Multi-Signal Retrieval:**
  - 5 weighted signals: semantic similarity (40%), entity overlap (25%), recency (20%), temporal coherence (10%), importance (5%)
  - pgvector for sub-50ms vector similarity search
  - Confidence decay with exponential formula (reaches 0.5 after 60 days without validation)

  **Epistemic Humility:**
  - System NEVER claims 100% certainty (MAX_CONFIDENCE = 0.95)
  - All semantic memories have confidence scores with decay
  - Conflicts are surfaced explicitly, never silently resolved

  **Technical Quality:**
  - Pure hexagonal architecture (domain layer has ZERO infrastructure imports)
  - 100% type coverage (mypy --strict mode)
  - 130+ tests with 85% coverage (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E)
  - Property-based testing with Hypothesis for invariant validation
  - Structured logging (JSON) for production observability

  **Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 15, pgvector, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Alembic, pytest, mypy, Ruff

  **Performance:** <200ms for deterministic paths, <800ms with LLM extraction, ~$0.002 per conversational turn
